## Introduction

In the first stage of the ExperimentAI Challenge, you will explore AI applications by playing with some that use machine learning, which is an approach used to create AI applications. You will create your first machine learning model and think about who will use your AI application and how it can improve their life.

You might not realise it, but artificial intelligence systems are already in your daily life. Yep, it's not just for robots and sci-fi movies!
<br><br>
If you watch videos on <b>YouTube</b>, listen to music on <b>Spotify</b>, or stream content through <b>Netflix</b>, AI applications record what content you have watched and recommend new content to you based on your preferences. If you use Snapchat filters, machine learning models are used to recognise where faces appear in the picture.

AI applications are powerful tools in many areas, from aiding scientists to categorise stars in the sky üåå to selecting ripe fruit ready for shipping to stores üçé. They operate efficiently and effectively in the background, providing substantial assistance when properly utilised. So, when you observe processes that sort or identify, consider the possibility: "Is this the work of AI?"
