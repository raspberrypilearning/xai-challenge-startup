## Introduction

In this first stage of the ExperimentAI Challenge, you will explore AI applications by playing with some fun apps which use Machine Learning (an approach taken to create AI applications), creating your first machine learning model and thinking about who will use your AI application and how it can improve their life. You'll also need to pick which kind of data your application will classify: numbers, text, audio or images.

You might not realise it, but artificial intelligence systems are already in your life every day. Yep, it's not just for robots and sci-fi movies!
<br><br>
If you watch videos on <b>YouTube</b>, listen to music on <b>Spotify</b>, or stream content through <b>Netflix</b> - AI applications record what content you have watched and recommend new content to you based on your preferences. If you use Snapchat filters, those use Machine Learning models to recognise where faces appear in the picture.

AI applications serve as a powerful tool in various domains, from aiding scientists in categorizing stars in the sky üåå to selecting ripe fruit in stores üçé. They operate efficiently and effectively in the background, providing substantial assistance once properly utilized. So, when observing sorting or identifying processes, consider the possibility: "Could this be the work of AI?"
