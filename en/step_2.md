## Introduction

In this first stage of the ExperimentAI Music quest, you will explore AI by playing with some fun apps which use Machine Learning (an approach taken to create AI applications), creating your first machine learning model and thinking about who will use your AI and Spotify application and how it can improve their life.

You might not realise it, but artificial intelligence is already in your life every day. 
<br><br>
If you watch videos on <b>YouTube</b>, listen to music on <b>Spotify</b>, or stream content through <b>Netflix</b> - AI applications record what content you have watched and recommend new content to you based on your preferences.
<br><br>
The more content you access and rate, the more data the AI application records, meaning better predictions can be made about what you might like. This works the same way for shopping, news headlines, search results and social media. In fact - nearly every single recommendation you see online is targeted to you based on your internet history and machine learning!
