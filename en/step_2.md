## Introduction

In this first stage of the ExperimentAI Challenge, you will explore AI by playing with some fun apps which use Machine Learning (an approach taken to create AI applications), creating your first machine learning model and thinking about who will use your AI application and how it can improve their life. You'll also need to pick which kind of data your aplpication will classify: numbers, text, audio or images.

You might not realise it, but artificial intelligence is already in your life every day. Yep, it's not just for robots and sci-fi movies.

If you watch videos on <b>YouTube</b>, listen to music on <b>Spotify</b>, or stream content through <b>Netflix</b> - AI applications record what content you have watched and recommend new content to you based on your preferences. If you use Snapchat filters, those use Machine Learning to recognise where faces appear in the picture.

From helping scientists sort stars in the sky üåå to picking out ripe fruit in stores üçé, AI is like that quiet classmate who turns out to be super helpful when you get to know them. So, next time you see something getting sorted or identified, take a moment to wonder: "Is AI behind this magic?" ‚ú®
