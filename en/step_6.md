## What next?

Continue on your your journey through the **Experience AI Challenge** and move on to Stage 2 - Create a classification app.

This is a warm-up exercise to get you used to using machine learning platforms in your chosen data type. You'll build your own model and app in Stage 3 based on the data type you choose for your warm-up now. 

But first, you need to decide what sort of data you want to use in **your** application. There are three options for you to choose from; **Images**, **Audio** or **Text**. 

--- task ---

**Choose JUST ONE of the options below to continue your quest.** 

The warm-up projects for each data type are:

**Image Classifier:** [Seefood](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-image-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning classifier that can predict whether a picture is of a hotdog...or not.

**Audio Classifier:** [Chatterbox](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-audio-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning model that can control a character on screen when you say the words 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'.

**Text Classifier:** [Hero or Villain](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-text-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning model that can predict whether the text you enter would most likely be said by a hero or a villain.
