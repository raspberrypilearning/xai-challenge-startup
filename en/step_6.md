## What next?

Continue on your your journey through the **Experience AI Challenge** and move on to Stage 2 - Create a classification app.

This is a warm-up exercise to get you used to using machine learning platforms in your chosen data type. You'll build your own model and app in Stage 3! But first, you need to decide what sort of model and data you want to work with.

**Click one of the options below to continue your quest.**

The warm-up projects for each data type are:

**Images:** [Seefood](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-image-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning classifier that can tell whether a picture is of a hotdog...or not.

**Audio:** [Chatterbox](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-audio-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning model that can control a character on screen when it hears the words 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'.

**Text:** [Hero or Villain](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/xai-challenge-text-classifier){:target="_blank"}: Create a machine learning model that can tell whether the text you enter would most likely be said by a hero or a villain.
