## Welcome!
**You’re about to become a creator of an artificial intelligence (AI) system.** This guide will help you through the process of designing, coding, training, and testing a machine learning (ML) model that will classify data and do whatever you can think of!


### To complete the Experience AI Challenge, you will: 
+ Create a machine learning model that classifies one of three types of data: text, audio, or images
+ Train a machine learning model using categories of data you choose
+ Create an application in Scratch that uses your machine learning model to do something cool!

### To complete the challenge, you’ll need:
+ A computer with an internet connection
+ A [Blueprint](resources/blueprint.pdf){:target="_blank"} document or notebook to record your plan

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Use the <b>Blueprint document</b> to keep notes on your project as it progresses, and to answer the design questions in the spaces provided - it helps to keep your ideas in one place. (Write your name on it now, so it doesn't get lost!) If you don't have a Blueprint, you can keep your notes on a piece of paper or a notebook.
</p>

#### Optional extras
+ Headphones (recommended, but not necessary) or speakers
+ A microphone if you want to record audio
+ A camera if you want to take pictures (**not** **required** for image classification)
