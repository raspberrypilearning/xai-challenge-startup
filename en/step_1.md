## Welcome!
**You’re about to become a creator of artificial intelligence. (AI)** The guide you are now reading will help you through the process of designing, coding, training and testing a Machine Learning (ML) model that will use an online music database to create the soundtrack to your life!


### By completing the Experiment AI Music Quest quest you will: 
+ Create a Scratch project that can search for and play songs from an online music database
+ Train a machine learning model using categories of songs that suit your lifestyle
+ Create a Scratch project that takes the data from your machine learning model and predicts music based on your tastes
