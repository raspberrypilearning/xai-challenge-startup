## Welcome!
**You’re about to become a creator of artificial intelligence (AI).** The guide you are now reading will help you through the process of designing, coding, training and testing a Machine Learning (ML) model that will classify data and do whatever you can think of!


### By completing the Experiment AI Challenge you will: 
+ Create a machine learning model that classifies one of four types of data: numbers, text, audio or images
+ Train a machine learning model using categories of data you choose
+ Create a Scratch project that takes the data from your machine learning model and does something based on the new data your user provides

### To complete the Challenge you’ll need:
+ A computer with an internet connection
+ A printed [Blueprint](resources/blueprint.pdf){:target="_blank"} document to record your plan

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Use the <b>Blueprint document</b> you've been given to keep notes on your project as it progresses, and answer the design questions in the spaces provided - it helps to keep your ideas in one place. (Write your name on it now, so it doesn't get lost!)
</p>

#### Optional Extras
+ Headphones (recommended but not necessary) or speakers
+ A microphone if you want to record audio
+ A camera if you want to take pictures (**not** **required** for image classification)

### Let's get started!
