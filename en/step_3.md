## What is AI and Machine Learning?

**Artificial intelligence** (AI) is a type of computing technology that helps machines perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence. This includes tasks like recognizing speech, identifying objects in images, and processing vast amounts of data autonomously. Instead of imitating human intelligence, AI crafts algorithms and systems that can comprehend and act on information without humans dictating every single step.

Most coding you've done before is likely **rules-based**. That means you've provided the computer with a specific set of instructions it must follow exactly: `If this, then that.` 

However, machine learning (ML) doesn't work that way â€” it's **data-driven**.  Instead of using lots and lots of rules to cover every possibility, machine learning takes large amounts of data about a particular topic to build an ML model. The ML model is a representation of something. Usually the representation is of the real world, but it can also be of an imaginary context.

<h3>Example: Digital Plant Identifier</h3>
Imagine you're on a nature walk and you come across a plant you've never seen before. You're curious to know what it is. With a digital plant identifier, you can snap a photo of it, and the app will tell you its name!
<br><br>
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Leaf Shape:</span> The model might look for specific patterns or shapes commonly found in certain plants. Long and thin or broad and open? One frond or multiple?
<br><br>
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Flower Color:</span> Bright red? Soft purple? The hue might give away the plant's identity.
<br><br>
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Size and Height:</span> Some plants are tall; others are short. This can be another clue.
<br><br>
When you upload a picture to the app, it sifts through its database of plant images and matches your photo to the closest resemblance, classifying it as a specific plant.

It would be a colossal task to manually craft rules for identifying every single plant. But with machine learning, it's possible to develop an **image classification model** that uses pictures to classify and recognize various plant species:

Imagine you have a big box of puzzle pieces, and each piece has a picture of a plant on it. At first, you might not know which plant is which. But if you look at enough puzzle pieces and someone tells you the name of the plant on each piece, you'll start to notice differences between them, like the shape of the leaves or the color of the flowers.

An image classification model does something similar. It looks at lots and lots of pictures of plants, and it learns the differences between them. So, when you show it a new picture of a plant, it can check that picture against all the others it has seen before and tell you what kind of plant it most likely is. It's like a quick game of "match the puzzle piece" every time it sees a new photo.

Can you think of other scenarios where machines need to classify inputs into categories, or recognise specific things in your daily life? (**Hint:** not all things just look at pictures! Some ML models detect different sounds or voices, some use written words and others still use numbers and information about things like the weather!)
